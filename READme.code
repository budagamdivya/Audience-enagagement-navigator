README: Predictive Analysis of Marketing Campaigns
Author: SaiDivyaSree Budagam

Overview:
---------
This code is a part of a personal project titled "Audience Engagement Navigator" that analyzes the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using Python and machine learning techniques.

Objective:
----------
To simulate a marketing dataset and develop a predictive model that forecasts Return on Investment (ROI) based on features such as impressions, clicks, and spend.

Key Technologies:
-----------------
- Python (3.10+)
- NumPy: for numerical data generation and manipulation.
- Pandas: for structured data processing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: for building and evaluating machine learning models.

Code Workflow:
--------------
1. Import required libraries and packages.
2. Generate a synthetic dataset of 100 marketing campaigns with variables:
   - Impressions
   - Clicks
   - Spend
   - ROI
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships.
4. Visualize data using scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and histograms.
5. Apply Linear Regression to build a predictive model for ROI.
6. Evaluate model accuracy using RÂ² score.
7. Present model insights with annotated visualizations.

Expected Output:
----------------
- Correlation insights between marketing spend and ROI.
- A trained regression model with accuracy metrics.
- Visual representation of predicted vs actual ROI values.

How to Run:
-----------
- Use a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment with the mentioned packages installed.
- Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

Installation (if required):
---------------------------
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Notes:
------
This code simulates a realistic data scenario and is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes. 
It can be adapted for real-world datasets with minimal adjustments.
