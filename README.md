Project Overview

The Audience Engagement Navigator is a data-driven tool designed to empower marketers by providing actionable insights into campaign performance. The project integrates machine learning and interactive visualization to predict key metrics like ROI, helping optimize marketing strategies.

Objectives:

-Simulate a realistic dataset for marketing campaigns.

-Analyze key trends in audience engagement.

-Build a predictive model to forecast ROI.

-Visualize insights using plots and dashboards.

Features:

Simulated Campaign Dataset - Generates realistic metrics like impressions, clicks, engagement rates, spend, and ROI.

Data Analysis:
Visualizations include:
Correlation heatmaps.
ROI distribution plots.
Scatterplots for engagement trends.

Predictive Modeling:
Linear regression model to predict ROI based on campaign metrics.

Interactive Dashboard (Planned):
Visualization of campaign insights in real-time.


Dataset:

The project uses a simulated dataset generated with Python.

Key columns include:

Campaign ID, Impressions, Clicks, Engagement Rate, Spend, ROI, Audience Age Group, and Region.


Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Version Control: Git, GitHub


Installation:

2.Navigate to the project directory: cd audience-engagement-navigator

3.Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

1.Run the dataset generation script: python generate_dataset.py

2.Perform data analysis and visualization: python data_analysis.py

3.Build and evaluate the predictive model: python predictive_model.py

4.View the saved dataset and results:
Dataset: Audience_Engagement_Navigator_Simulated_Data.csv
Plots and metrics will be saved in the output folder (if implemented).


Results:
